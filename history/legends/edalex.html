	<p><b>Edward Fales Alexander, 
	1942 - 2009</b></p>
	<p>Edward Alexander was an extraordinary person 
	and a special friend to all who knew him. His sudden, tragic passing on 
	October 17, 2009, in an accident on the Medina River, has left a large void 
	in our lives but we can continue to enjoy the rich tapestry he wove during 
	his much too short but brilliantly traveled journey. Ed never met a 
	stranger. Together, he and his beloved wife Brigit joyfully welcomed all 
	comers to their enchanted homes in Real de Catorce, Mexico, and Austin, 
	Texas. Ed had more friends than there are stars in the Texas sky and all who 
	were blessed to have known him are better, happier people for the 
	experience.
                        <p>Ed was born in Amarillo, Texas on November 25, 1942. He loved 
	his Texas roots, a favorite topic for his endless tales. He graduated from 
	Vanderbilt University and received a graduate degree in physics from the 
	University of Texas at Austin in 1968. Ed was always in the middle of the 
	fun, both the kindest and most cantankerous of the bunch, at once a shining 
	light on your shoulder and a practical man of the earth. A traveler at 
	heart, he trotted the globe the way some people walk around the block.
                        <p>Of 
	his adventures, perhaps Ed loved those involving caves most of all. Having 
	joined the NSS earlier he fell in with a circle of Austin cavers in 1964 and 
	those adventurers remained friends to the end; they were with him at the 
	Texas Cavers Reunion in Paradise Canyon the night he died. Ed and Brigit met 
	in Real de Catorce, Mexico, and they were married in 1992. Before moving 
	back to Austin in 2008, Ed and his family lived for twelve years in Catorce.
                        <p>Ed continued to explore, traveling and camping around Mexico and hiking the Catorce Range with family and friends and his dog, Cleo. He would load up 
	his red Isuzu Trooper with Brigit and son Luc and put his daughter Mimi on 
	top with Cleo running behind as they climbed up the rugged mountain roads to 
	scenic, wonderful places. If Luc found a snake in the road, Ed would pick it 
	up and preserve it in the freezer for later dissection with the kids. 
	Learning was an everyday adventure at the Alexander home. Ed's children, 
	Thomas, Mimi and Luc--kind, compassionate, and curiosity-filled--are a 
	testament to the care and love Ed gave them. From his youngest days Thomas 
	was always included with the many adventures of Ed whether camping in the 
	Sierra Madres, cooking at the TCR events or running the rivers of Central 
	Texas. Ed traveled the road from Austin to Catorce and back with Thomas many 
	times. If night fell and they were tired, they would pull off the road, put 
	down their sleeping bags and sleep under the stars.
                        <p>The stories about Ed 
	would fill a book; the stories that he told would fill another. His life 
	revolved around all kinds of human communities in Austin and Mexico: cavers, 
	musicians, river runners, movie makers, artists, craftspeople, 
	archeologists, and computer programmers.
                        <p>Ed was preceded in death by his 
	parents, Kleim and Myrtle Alexander, and his brother Charles. He is survived 
	by his wife, Brigit; daughter, Mimi; and sons, Thomas and Luc; nephew, Chuck 
	and niece Susanne.
                        <p>Vaya con Dios, Eduardo. We miss you so much. A 
	celebration of Ed's life with family and friends has been planned. Friends 
	are encouraged to bring a picture, a written memory or a memento to be 
	included in a book for his family to keep.<br clear="all">
